NAME
----
kdump - Configuration of kdump

SYNOPSIS
--------
/etc/sysconfig/kdump

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This configuration file provides various options for the kdump loading and
saving process. It's mostly read by *kdumptool*(8) but also by the kdump init
script.

OPTIONS
-------

The file format consists of shell variables (which means that the configuration
file is actually parsed by a *sh*(1) compatible shell) that are described below.
It's recommended to use a pair of double quotes to assign values to that
variables.


KDUMP_KERNELVER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kernel Version string for the -kdump kernel, such as "2.6.25-5-kdump".
The init script will use a kernel named _/boot/vmlinu[zx]-$KDUMP_KERNELVER_.
Using "kdump" will default to the most recently installed kdump kernel
(to which the symbolic link _/boot/vmlinuz-kdump_ points).

If no version is specified, then the init script will try to find a kdump kernel
with the algorithm described below.

Default is "" which means that the auto-detection described above is used.

Kernel auto-detection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's assume that a kernel name _KERNELRELEASE_ consists of _BASEVERSION_ and a
_FLAVOUR_ on SUSE. For example consider the kernel release ("uname -r")
"2.6.25.18-0.2-default". Then the _BASEVERSION_ is "2.6.25.18-0.2" (but there
are also _BASEVERSION_ strings without a dash) and the _FLAVOUR_ is "default".

To find out if a kernel is suitable as capture kernel, there are strong
and weak requirements. The strong requirements mean that you just cannot use the
kernel as kdump kernel:

* Either the kernel must be a special kdump kernel with a modified
  start address *or*
* the kernel is relocatable.

The weak requirements mean that a kernel is not good as kdump kernel so it
should be avoided when better kernels are installed. A kernel does not
fulfil that weak requirements when

* It is a realtime kernel (since the interrupt handling is different and
  _irqpoll_ has problems) *or*
* the kernel is compiled for a huge number of CPUs (above 1024 in our case)
  since that means that the capure kernel needs more memory.

After all that definition, the algorithm tries following kernels in that order:

. _BASEVERSION_-kdump (e.g. /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.27-rc1-kdump)
. kdump (e.g. /boot/vmlinuz-kdump)
. _KERNELRELEASE_ (e.g. /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.27-rc1-kdump), strong check
. _BASEVERSION_-default (e.g. /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.27-rc1-default), strong check
. "" (e.g. /boot/vmlinuz), strong check
. _KERNELRELEASE_ (e.g. /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.27-rc1-kdump), weak check
. "" (e.g. /boot/vmlinuz), weak check

On each item, it tries:

. /boot/*vmlinuz
. /boot/*vmlinux

Initrd
^^^^^^

For the initrd, if the kernel name already contains "kdump", then the initrd
_/boot/initrd-<kernelver>_ is used. Else, we use
_/boot/initrd-<kernelver>-kdump_ (the kernel flavour is not replaced, so for
example this means _/boot/initrd-2.6.25.9-0.2-default-kdump_. This is because
the initrd used for kdump always has to be special, and it makes no sense to
load the normal initrd that would not save the dump.



KDUMP_CPUS
~~~~~~~~~~

If dumping is CPU-bound on your system, you can parallelize it on an SMP
system. Keep in mind that this increases the stress on the I/O subsystem,
so you probably don't get the maximum speed if you set this parameter to
the number of CPUs in your system.

This parameter modifies the _maxcpus_ parameter of the kdump kernel and
the number of *makedumpfile*(8) processes created.

If the value is zero, all available CPUs are used, i.e. the _maxcpus_
parameter is not added to the kdump kernel command line.

*Note:* This parameter does not work properly for the _ELF_ format,
because *makedumpfile*(8) does not support split _ELF_ dump files.

Default is 1.


KDUMP_COMMANDLINE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Command line used to boot the kdump kernel. By default, the _/etc/init.d/kdump_
script tries to build a command line automatically from the command line of the
running system, preserving root partition, serial console, etc. If you manually
create a command line, make sure to include:

* the _root_ parameter,
* any _console_ parameters (for serial console),
* _irqpoll_,
* _reset_devices_,
* _elevator=deadline_ to save the memory footprint.

The last three parameters are special for kdump and should always be included,
if you don't have a good reason to exclude them.

If you only want to extend the kernel command line with your own parameter(s),
use KDUMP_COMMANDLINE_APPEND.

Default is "".


KDUMP_COMMANDLINE_APPEND
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This variable describes all command line parameters that are passed to the kdump
kernel additionally to the default parameters.

For network based dumping, you may have to add a _net_delay_ parameter to
specify the extra delay in seconds that is needed for the network device
to become fully operational, e.g. _net_delay=20_ will wait 20 seconds before
continuing after the network device is configured. This parameter is used by
the network setup code in the resulting initrd.

See also KDUMP_COMMANDLINE.

Default is "".

KDUMP_AUTO_RESIZE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Memory for the crash kernel is reserved at boot time. It is a large
block that must be continuous in physical address space, and such
allocations must be early because of memory fragmentation. However,
the Linux kernel allows to shrink this reserved area later, and this
is what kdump does before loading the panic kernel when this option
is turned on.

The intention is that the _crashkernel_ boot option is set to the
maximum possible value (e.g. half of available RAM), which should be
enough for the worst case. When the system boots, it checks the
actual requirements and reduces the reservation accordingly.

Note that this option is ignored if the reservation is not done by
the Linux kernel, i.e. under the Xen hypervisor, or when using
FADUMP on IBM POWER.

Default is "no".

ifeval::['@HAVE_FADUMP@'=='TRUE']

KDUMP_FADUMP
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If this option is set to "yes", kdump will use the FADUMP mechanism
(firmware-assisted dump). With this option, the secondary kernel is never
loaded from the primary kernel. Instead, the kdump feature is added to the
standard initrd. If the primary kernel crashes, the firmware reboots the
machine in a special environment. The initrd detects this environment on
boot, saves the dump, and continues with normal startup.

*Note:* FADUMP is only available on powerpc.

Default is "no".

KDUMP_FADUMP_SHELL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When this option is "yes", kdump launches a shell after saving the dump.
If FADUMP is disabled, this option has no effect, because launching a shell
is the default action when KDUMP_IMMEDIATE_REBOOT is set to "no".

This option can be useful for debugging.

Default is "no".

endif::[]

KEXEC_OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional options for *kexec*(8).

Default is "" except on IA64 where it is "--noio".


MAKEDUMPFILE_OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional options for *makedumpfile*(8). makedumpfile will be used to save the
dump if KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL is non-zero or KDUMP_DUMPFORMAT is not _ELF_.
Normally, you don't have to specify any options here, but you may be asked in
Bugzilla to add the _-D_ option for debugging.

Default is "".


KDUMP_IMMEDIATE_REBOOT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Immediately reboot after saving the core in the kdump kernel? Use "yes" or "no".

ifeval::['@HAVE_FADUMP@'=='TRUE']
If this option is set to "no" and FADUMP is enabled, normal boot process
continues after saving the dump. This can save one reboot, but on NUMA
systems all node-level memory is allocated on the dumping node, degrading
the performance of all other nodes until reboot.
endif::[]

Default is "yes".

KDUMP_TRANSFER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A script or command executed to process and transfer the dump image.
It can read the dump image either via /proc/vmcore or /dev/oldmem. Most other
variables will have no effect if you use a custom command here.

It's important that all requirements including that script itself are included
in KDUMP_REQUIRED_PROGRAMS.

It's strongly recommended that the default mechanism is used, it should provide
everything that is needed, together with KDUMP_PRESCRIPT and
KDUMP_POSTSCRIPT. We can't support problems with using that variable.

KDUMP_PRESCRIPT and KDUMP_POSTSCRIPT are not executed if KDUMP_TRANSFER is set.

Default: "".


KDUMP_SAVEDIR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The directory where dumps are saved to. If the directory does not exist, it will
be created. The directory is a URL and must conform to the syntax described in
the section "URL FORMAT" below. If the directory does not exist, it will be
created. (That is true for all targets, even network targets. Of course the user
must have the permission to create directories.)

Below that directory, for each dump a directory with a time stamp in the
following format will be created: "YYYY-MM-TT-HH:MM". That directory contains
the dump and various other files, depending which dump target will be used and
which dump settings are made.

If KDUMP_COPY_KERNEL is set, that directory will also contain the kernel.

You can specify multiple targets separated by spaces. The dump will then be
split and saved to all target directories in parallel. This is useful if the
targets are on different storage devices, because their combined I/O bandwidth
can be used.
Note how this option interacts with KDUMP_CPUS.  If you specify more CPUs than
target locations, then they will be assigned to the available processes in a
round-robin fashion (i.e. more than one process will be writing to the same
directory). If you specify more locations than CPUs, then only the first
KDUMP_CPUS locations will be used.
This feature is supported only for local files using the kdump-compressed
format.

Default: "file:///var/log/dump".


KDUMP_KEEP_OLD_DUMPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Number of old dumps to keep. That variable is only honored on local directories
(i.e., if KDUMP_SAVEDIR starts with _file_) because we think it's bad from a
security point of view if other hosts delete stuff (that may be from another
hosts) on a dump server. The deletion process takes place before the dumps are
saved. So if you specify 3 here, then after the dump has been saved, 4 dumps are
on disk.

Set that variable to "0" to disable the deletion of dumps entirely, and set
that variable to "-1" to delete all dumps, i.e. then only the just saved dump is
on disk.

Default: "5"


KDUMP_FREE_DISK_SIZE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure that at least KDUMP_FREE_DISK_SIZE megabytes are free on the target
partition after saving the dump file. Since the target dump file size may not
be known (because of compression and/or filtering), *kdump* always attempts to
save the dump, but checks remaining free space afterwards and deletes the dump
directory again if remaining space is less than the value specified here.

This option applies only to local file systems, i.e. KDUMP_SAVEDIR must start
with _file_.

Default: "64"


KDUMP_VERBOSE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bit mask of several options that set the verbosity of the dump process. To apply
several options, you have to add their value. The options are:

1::
  kdump command line is written to system log when executing /etc/init.d/kdump.

2::
  Progress is written to stdout while dumping.

4::
  kdump command line is written so standard output when executing
  /etc/init.d/kdump.

8::
  Debugging for kdump transfer mechanism. That is executed in initrd and
  generates lots of output. However, it's very useful if something does not
  work.

16::
  Debugging when loading the kdump kernel. That creates lots of output to
  stdout, so only use if you really want to debug that. It is useful if
  kdump reports that it cannot find a suitable kernel but you think kdump
  is wrong.

So, for example, if you want to have the command line on stdout when loading the
kernel and also in the system log, just use KDUMP_VERBOSE = 5 (i.e. 1 + 4).

Default: "3".


KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Determines the dump level. If KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL is non-zero, then
*makedumpfile*(8) is used to strip pages that may not be necessary for
analysing. 0 means no stripping, and 31 is the maximum dump level, i.e.
0 produces the largest dump files and 31 the smallest.

The following table from makedumpfile(8) shows what each dump level means:

'------------.----------.----------.-------------.---------.----------
dump level   zero page  cache page cache private user data free page
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 0

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Default: "31"


KDUMP_DUMPFORMAT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This variable specifies the dump format.


*none*::
  Do not generate any dump file. This is useful if you only want the kernel
  log buffer, because it minimizes disk space requirements and also greatly
  reduces the time involved in waiting for the dump to complete.

*ELF*::
  _ELF_ has the advantage that it's a standard format and GDB can be used to
  analyse the dumps. The disadvantage is that the dump files are larger.

*compressed*::
  _compressed_ is the kdump compressed format that produces small dumps, see
  *makedumpfile*(8).  However, only *crash*(8) can analyse the dumps and
  makedumpfile must be installed (but you need it anyway if you set
  KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL to non-zero before).

*lzo*::
  _lzo_ is similar to _compressed_, but it uses the LZO compression algorithm
  instead of gzip. This usually results in slightly bigger files, but it is
  much faster. You will need *crash*(8) version 6.0.7 or later to open the
  dump file.

*snappy*::
  _snappy_ is very similar to _lzo_, but it uses the Snappy compression
  algorithm. It is usually considerably faster and achieves approximately
  the same compression ratio. Snappy is optimized for 64-bit, little-endian
  architectures (e.g. x86_64).

Default: "compressed"


KDUMP_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If something goes wrong while saving the dump or deleting old dumps in initrd,
then *kdumptool*(8) normally tries to execute the next action. However, it can
be useful to open a shell at that point in time and fix or debug the problem.
This happens when KDUMP_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR is set to "false".

Default: "true"


KDUMP_REQUIRED_PROGRAMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a space-separated list of programs (full path) that are required by
KDUMP_TRANSFER, KDUMP_PRESCRIPT or KDUMP_POSTSCRIPT. Dynamic libraries that are
required by that programs don't have to be included as they are resolved
automatically. However, it's necessary to include other runtime requirements
because it's not possible to resolve them automatically.

Default: ""


KDUMP_PRESCRIPT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Program that is executed before taking the dump. You have to include that
program in KDUMP_REQUIRED_PROGRAMS.

Default: ""


KDUMP_POSTSCRIPT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Program that is executed after taking the dump and before the system is
rebooted. You have to include that program in KDUMP_REQUIRED_PROGRAMS.

As a special case, if KDUMP_POSTSCRIPT contains +/usr/lib/fence_kdump_send+,
this script is automatically added to the initrd, and network is configured by
default.

Default: ""


KDUMP_COPY_KERNEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not only copy the dump to KDUMP_SAVEDIR but also the installed kernel. Valid
values are "yes" and "no". If you want to have the debugging information also
copied, which is required to open the program, you also have to install the
_kernel-<flavour>-debuginfo_ package.

Modules are not copied, only the kernel image and the debugging file.

Default: "yes"


KDUMPTOOL_FLAGS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a space-separated list of flags to tweak the run-time behaviour of
*kdumptool*(8). These flags are recognized:

*NOSPARSE*::
  Disable the creation of sparse-files. This flag is for debugging purposes,
  e.g. if the file system or network protocol has problems with sparse files.
  Because SFTP and FTP are not mounted, that option has no meaning when saving
  the dump to SFTP and FTP.

*SPLIT*::
  If KDUMP_CPUS>1, use the _--split_ option of *makedumpfile*(8) instead of
  the default _--num-threads_.

*SINGLE*::
  Specify this flag to force the use of only one CPU for dumping, regardless
  of the value of KDUMP_CPUS.
  It disables the _--split_ and _--num-threads_ options of *makedumpfile*(8).

  For compatibility with older versions, *NOSPLIT* is an alias for *SINGLE*.
  Its use is deprecated.

*XENALLDOMAINS*::
  When dumping a Xen virtualization host, *makedumpfile*(8) is normally
  invoked with the _-X_ option to exclude DomU pages. This flag can be
  used to include all pages in the dump.

Default: ""

KDUMP_NETCONFIG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Network configuration for kdump. Because the dump process runs in initrd, the
network configuration is different from the normal network configuration. Use
_auto_ to auto-detect the network configuration (see *auto* mode below). The
interface with the default route will be used. This is the default.

Network is configured only if needed, e.g. the dump target is on a remote
machine, or an email notification should be sent. If network is needed by
something else, such as a custom script used as KDUMP_PRESCRIPT or
KDUMP_POSTSCRIPT, add a _:force_ suffix to the network configuration, for
example "auto:force" or "eth0:dhcp4:force".

Use a _netdevice:mode_ string to force a specific network device to be used. A
_netdevice_ is for example "eth0". The _mode_ can be:

*static*::
  Always re-use the current configuration of _netdevice_ (both IPv4 and IPv6).
  Note that only permanent global IPv6 addresses are stored, because temporary
  addresses are likely to expire before the system crashes, and link-local
  addresses are set up automatically.

*auto6*::
  Use IPv6 autoconfiguration to get an address on the interface.

*dhcp*::
*dhcp4*::
  Use DHCP to configure an IPv4 address on the interface.

*dhcp6*::
  Use DHCP6 to configure an IPv6 address on the interface.

*auto*::
  Select the mode depending on the current state of the interface:

  * use DHCP4 if it has an IPv4 address (IPv6 not set up),
  * use DHCP6 if it has a permanent IPv6 address (IPv4 not set up),
  * use IPv6 auto-configuration if it has neither (IPv4 not set up).

Auto-detection cannot be used to set up dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) hosts
because of limitations in the implementation of the _ip=_ initrd command line
option.

*Note:* If an _ip=_ option is found in KDUMP_COMMANDLINE or
KDUMP_COMMANDLINE_APPEND, kdump does not add any other _ip=_ or _ifname=_
options. In other words, the value of KDUMP_NETCONFIG is effectively ignored.

Setting KDUMP_NETCONFIG to "" disables network completely. In this case, kdump
does not even add the _network_ dracut module to the initrd.

Default: "auto"

KDUMP_SMTP_SERVER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to get an email after the dump has been copied, you can specify an
SMTP server here. It's valid to specify a hostname, an IP address. Optionally,
you can also specify a port with the usual _:port_ syntax.

Example: smtp.myprovider.de:25

If you provide a username (KDUMP_SMTP_USER) and a password
(KDUMP_SMTP_PASSWORD), then SMTP AUTH will be used. Otherwise, plain SMTP with
no authentication will be used.

Default: ""

KDUMP_SMTP_USER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Username used for SMTP authentication. Also specify KDUMP_SMTP_PASSWORD in that
case. If no username and/or no password will be provided, plain SMTP will be
used.

Default: ""

KDUMP_SMTP_PASSWORD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Password used for SMTP authentication. Also specify KDUMP_SMTP_USER in that
case. If no username and/or no password will be provided, plain SMTP will be
used.

Default: ""

KDUMP_NOTIFICATION_TO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Email address where notification mails should be sent to. Don't specify a
real name here, only an email address. You have to configure a SMTP server with
KDUMP_SMTP_SERVER to use that feature.

Example: john@myprovider.de

Default: ""

KDUMP_NOTIFICATION_CC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Space-separated list of email addresses where notification mails should be sent
to via Cc. Don't specify real names here, only email addresses. You have to
configure a SMTP server with KDUMP_SMTP_SERVER to use that feature.

Example: "john@myprovider.de doe@myprovider.de"

Default: ""

KDUMP_SSH_HOST_KEY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Target host key encoded with base64, i.e. as found in +~/.ssh/known_hosts+.
This is used for the SFTP transfer protocol to verify the authenticity of
the remote host. If this field is left empty, the setup scripts will try
to get it automatically using *ssh-keygen -F $target_host*.

If you want to disable host key checking, set this variable to "*".

Example (broken into lines for readability):

  AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEAxIJIeuVX0F0u53wMgH22fdl62ifLXRwaPAXPsCr
  vyerMEb5DXHnIv1sYdzlJ1g/2Iw+ppjGDh1En/P12Dpl2uLBZh0MOrM71spTjvTwV2M
  KZtXrYjZUIPIZdd9vrI+/LEI0nw7LSdnKKgkAIXMhaRrq9N6uoZWe41ilU4NpnL/k=

Default: ""

KDUMP_SSH_IDENTITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

List of SSH identity files for public key authentication. If empty, kdump
will try all standard OpenSSH identities for the 'root' user (rsa, dsa,
ecdsa, ed25519, in this order). The path to every identity file is relative
to +~root/.ssh+, or an absolute path can be given.

Example: "/root/.ssh/id_kdump_rsa"

Default: ""

URL FORMAT
----------

In general, the URL format is

_protocol_://_specification_

where _protocol_ is one of:

* *file*,
* *ftp*,
* *sftp* (alias is *scp*),
* *ssh*
* *nfs*
* *cifs* (alias is *smb*).

The _specification_ varies for each protocol.

Local files (_file_)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That type describes a local path.

_Format:_ [*file*://]/_path_

As shown, the _file_ prefix is optional, i.e. a simple path is still valid.
The _path_ must start with a leading slash (/), i.e. only absolute paths are
allowed.

_Examples:_

* +/var/log/dump+
* +file:///var/log/dump+


File Transfer Protocol (_ftp_)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This URL type is used to specify paths on a remote FTP server.

_Format:_ *ftp*://[_user_[:__password__]@]_hostname_[:__port__]/_path_

The remote _user_ is optional, if no user is specified, anonymous FTP is
assumed. Even if a username is specified, the _password_ is optional, if no
password is specified, an empty password is used. When the username is
"anonymous", then "$USER@$HOSTNAME" is used as password because some FTP
servers deny anonymous FTP with empty passwords.

_hostname_ can be either a (DNS-)resolvable hostname, with or without a domain
name, or an IP address in dotted decimal format. _port_ can be used to
specify the remote port, if no port is specified in the URL, the default FTP
port is used. Finally, _path_ must conform to the same rules as for local
files (see above).

_Examples:_

* +ftp://neptunium/var/log/dump+
* +ftp://bwalle@neptunium.suse.de/var/log/dump+
* +ftp://bwalle:dontsay@strauss.suse.de:123/var/log/dump+
* +ftp://192.168.0.70/var/log/dump+


Secure File Transfer Protocol (_sftp_)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This URL type is used to specify paths on a remote server that is reachable via
SFTP. It's important that an SFTP server must be running (which is the default
on SUSE), the *kdumptool* does not use FISH (FIles transferred over SHell
protocol).

_Format:_ *sftp*://\[__user__@]_hostname_[:__port__]/_path_

It's possible to use "scp" as an alias for "sftp" (for backward compatibility),
but it is a misnomer; *kdumptool* does not implement the SCP protocol and it
will use SFTP instead.

See the description of FTP for an explanation of the _hostname_ and _port_
elements.

After a system crash, the crashed machine first verifies the identity of the
target host to make sure it does not save the dump to an imposter. Then the
target host verifies the identity of the crashed machine. SSH private/public
key pairs are used in both cases.

Server Identification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since system dumps may contain sensitive information, *kdump* uses strict
host key checking for the target server. The SSH client must have a copy
of the public part of the target server's host key. The copy is kept in a
known_hosts file on the client. *Kdump* will use the key found in
+~root/.ssh/known_hosts+ when the kdump initrd is generated.

Client Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The crashed system uses root's private SSH key to login to the target system.
The public part of that key must be copied to the target user's
+~/.ssh/authorized_keys+ on the target host.

Example Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To set up _crasher_ for saving dumps over SFTP to _dump@collector_, follow
these steps:

1. Add the target host public key to +~root/.ssh/known_hosts+ on _crasher_,
   e.g.:
+
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
root@crasher:~# ssh-keyscan -t rsa,ecdsa,ed25519 collector \
	>> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
*WARNING:* Note that the above command accepts the identity of _collector_
without any checking that it is genuine. This is a security risk unless the
network connection between _crasher_ and _collector_ can be fully trusted when
you run this command.

2. Generate a private/public key pair for the _root_ user on _crasher_, e.g.
   to make a 4096-bit RSA key, run this as _root_:
+
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
root@crasher:~# ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
Do not use any password to encrypt the key. *kdumptool* is designed to be used
non-interactively.

3. Append the content of +\~.ssh/id_rsa.pub+ to +~dump/.ssh/authorized_keys+
   on _collector_:
+
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
root@crasher:~# ssh-copy-id dump@collector
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Examples:_

* +sftp://dump@collector:22/var/log/dump+
* +sftp://neptunium/var/log/dump+


Secure Shell Protocol (_ssh_)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike the _sftp_ URL type, this protocol does not use SFTP, but rather
transfers the data to a remote *dd* command.

_Format:_ *ssh*://\[__user__@]_hostname_[:__port__]/_path_

Most of the notes for SFTP also apply to SSH, except:

* SFTP need not be configured on the target host.
* Shell access must be granted to the dump user.
* The shell must allow execution of +mkdir+, +dd+ and +mv+.

_Examples:_

* +ssh://kdump@crashdump/srv/www/dump/incoming+


Network File System (_nfs_)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NFS is used to specify remote hosts that export their file system via NFS.
NFS doesn't use username and password. Also, the URL format cannot be used
to specify options. As default, the _nolock_ option is used.

_Format:_ *nfs*://_host_[:__port__]/_path_

_host_ is the hostname, _port_ is optional (should not be used, it is only
implemented for completeness with the other URL formats). _path_ specifies
the path that is exported via NFS in _/etc/exports_ (or a subdirectory of a
path that is exported).

_Examples:_

* +nfs://neptunium/var/log/dump+
* +nfs://10.10.2.120/var/log/dump+


Common Internet File System (_cifs_)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CIFS is used to specify remote hosts that export a file system via CIFS,
also known as SMB (although they are technically different, CIFS is the
successor of SMB). This could be a Microsoft Windows server, or a Samba
Server running on Unix or MacOS.

_Format:_ *cifs*://[_user_[:__password__]@]_host_/_path_

Although it's technically not 100 % correct, _smb_ is used as an alias for
_cifs_, so the program will always return _cifs_ even if you specify _smb_.

The parts of the URL are described in the FTP section above.

*Note:* You have to use the slash as path separator, not the backslash as on
Microsoft Windows.

_Examples:_

* +cifs://neptunium/var/log/dump+
* +cifs://bwalle:dontsay@neptunium:/var/log/dump+
* +smb://bwalle@192.168.0.70:/var/log+
