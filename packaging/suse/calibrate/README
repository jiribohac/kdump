On maintaining calibrate.conf
-----------------------------

kdumptool calibrate needs a config file populated with measured
memory values: /usr/lib/kdump/calibrate.conf

These values are determined by building the package with the
with_calibrate macro defined. This causes the build to run
an instrumented kdump environment in a qemu VM, tracking memory
consumption during the boot and execution of kdump.
All the values are recorded in calibrate.conf

Because SUSE needs stable builds and these values are not stable,
the package is normally not built with the with_calibrate macro.
Instead, pre-generated values are used in calibrate.conf.

The values in calibrate.conf are different for different distributions and
architectures. The package sources include a file calibrate.conf.all
with all possible distribution/architecture combinations. Every line is prefixed
with the distribution and architecture, following a ':'. The build
"greps" and "cuts" the appropriate set of values from this file into
/usr/lib/kdump/calibrate.conf

The values in calibrate.conf.all should be re-generated after major changes to
the distribution or when a new distribution/architecture is introduced. To do
this, the maintainer needs to:

1) build the package with with_calibrate
  
  One way to do this is to branch the package. In OBS, in the branched
  projects's "Project Config" tab, enter:
	  Macros:
	  %_with_calibrate 1
	  :Macros

  The package build will run qemu and generate a fresh calibrate.conf
  file, not using the pre-built values from calibrate.conf.all
  The generated calibrate.conf will contain one extra line, not normally present:
  GENERATED_ON=distro.arch 
  This is the prefix that should be used in calibrate.conf.all

2) extract calibrate.conf from the built RPMs for all the architectures and 
   distributions that you want to update the values for, prefix the lines with the 
   value of GENERATED_ON and update calibrate.conf.all with those lines

   To make this task easier, you can use the update_calibrate.py script.
   Run it in the directory with your branched osc package working copy.

   It will extract calibrate.conf from all the built kdump binaries in the project
   and update calibrate.conf.all with the extracted values.

   The old calibrate.conf.all is saved in calibrate.conf.all.old

3) make sure the changed values make sense by comparing calibrate.conf.all and 
   calibrate.conf.all.old and commit the new calibrate.conf.all
